# Stock_Price_EDA
During my data science journey, I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on stock prices of renowned companies like Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Amazon. This analysis aimed to gain valuable insights into the historical trends and patterns of these stocks.

Utilizing Python and relevant libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I acquired and preprocessed the stock price data. This involved cleaning and handling missing values, adjusting for stock splits, and aligning the data for consistent analysis.

To provide a comprehensive understanding of the stock prices, I conducted various visualizations and statistical analyses. I created graphs and charts to observe the overall trends, fluctuations, and seasonality in the stock prices over time.
This exploration yielded valuable insights into the historical trends, patterns, and interdependencies among these stocks, which can inform investment strategies and decision-making processes.

Furthermore, I employed correlation analysis to investigate the relationships between these stocks. By calculating correlation coefficients and generating heatmaps, I identified any significant dependencies or diversification opportunities among these companies.

Overall, my EDA on the stock prices of Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Amazon integrated data preprocessing, visualizations, statistical analysis. This exploration yielded valuable insights into the historical trends, patterns, and interdependencies among these stocks, which can inform investment strategies and decision-making processes.
